    In this theme we were introduced to html and css. We learned the basics to build a website structure and style it. We were also introduced to diferent design aspects like shape contrast, color contrast, gestalt and tipography styles. All those contents learned in this project were applied on future projects. I particularly used a lot of lights and color contrasts for this responsive website, due to the cinema noir style that i got.

    In this theme we learned an Adobe tool that was very used along the semester: Abobe XD. We learned to make a prototype that simulates the site flow and helps to visualize the future result. This was also used in other projects like design sprint and native app.

    This was the first video project that we had. We learned how to make scripts and improve the editor ability. I was the assistent editor and learned more about audios, frame continuations, cuts and title effects.

    This project was one of the most fun. In here we learned how to do a simple animation, with button commands. We could use our drawing skills in this project, and that also helped me to have a great animation frame understanding.

    In this group project we separated tasks to improve our progress. I was in charge of the UX. This was great learning for the future theme "Basic UX", specially since this was a interactive program. I learned a lot about intuitive navigation, DOs and DON`Ts.
